# openfga

WELCOME TO OPENFGA BACKSTAGE PLUGIN .

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/openfga](http://localhost:3000/openfga).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.


## Example Catalog Permission policy using openFGA

Lets take a scenario a role based access for backstage catalog delete/ungersitering an entity

Rules:

- A user who have OWNER access can read and delete the entity 
- A user who have VIEWER access can only read the entity not delete the entity
